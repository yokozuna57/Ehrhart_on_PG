# Ehrhart_on_PG

In this repository, we will distribute related materials for our papers on coordination sequences (CS) of periodic graphs. In particular, it includes a program for calculating the CS of 2D periodic graphs. The relevant papers are as follows:

[1] T. Inoue and Y. Nakamura, Ehrhart theory on periodic graphs, [arXiv: 2305.08177v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08177)

[2] T. Inoue and Y. Nakamura, Stratified Ehrhart ring theory on periodic graphs, arXiv: ???

- a program for calculating the CS of 2D periodic graphs: see [Python_d2_v0](./Python_d2_v0)
