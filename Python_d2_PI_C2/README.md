## _0_main.py

When you run `_0_main.py`, it will display the value of C1, whether a given vertex, which is 0 by default, is P-initial, and the value of C2 if it is P-initial, by default for the Wakatsuki Graph. For the meaning of the terms, please refer to [1].

The folder `tilingdata` contains several examples. To calculate for other periodic graphs, follow the instructions below.

1. Create input data within the folder `tilingdata`. For the input format, please refer [the main page](../README.md).
1. Import the created input data at the beginning of `_0_main.py` and modify the variables `data` and `x0`.
