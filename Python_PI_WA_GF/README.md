## _0_main.py

When you run `_0_main.py`, it will display the growth series and other data of SACADA #1.
To calculate for a different example, please modify the `data` around line 75 and `s` around line 98.

The folder `SACADApy` contains several data of SACADA (please refer to [HKGP16] and the website [sacada.info](https://www.sacada.info)). We have transformed original data mainly to reduce the kinds of vertices.

The folder `tilingdata` contains other several examples. To calculate for your own examples, follow the instructions below.

1. Create input data within the folder `tilingdata`. For the input format, please refer [the main page](../README.md).
1. Import the created input data at the beginning of `_0_main.py` and modify the variables `data` (and `s` if needed).
