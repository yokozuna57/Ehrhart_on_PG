## _0_main.py

When you run `_0_main.py`, it will display the CS, invariants (introduced in [2]), and the generating function of CS for the Wakatsuki Graph.
To calculate for a different example, please modify the `data` on line 16 and `x0` on line 22.

The folder `tilingdata` contains several examples. To calculate for other periodic graphs, follow the instructions below.

1. Create input data within the folder `tilingdata`. For the input format, please refer to the Appendix in [2].
1. Import the created input data at the beginning of `_0_main.py` and modify the variables `data` and `x0`.

## mkfig.py

`mkfig.py` is the code for visualizing 2D periodic graphs like Fig. 9-16 in [2]. Please refer to the code for more details.
